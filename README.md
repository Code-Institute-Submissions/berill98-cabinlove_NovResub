# Cabinlove

## The goal for this project

The Cabinlove is an online collection of cabins all over the world. I wanted to create a site where people could explore, create and share cabins in one place. I wanted to build a responsive site that can be accessed across all devices and display the information in an user-frienldy way, contributing to an overall good user experience.

## Site Owner Goals

## Gitpod Reminders

## User stories

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

## UX

### Fonts

- I have used Google Fonts to find the font that suits best to the feel of the website. I have used [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster) for the logo and the main titles.

### Icons

- The icons on the website were taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colors and images

- The main colours on the website are different browns, white, and dark green. This is because I wanted to use natural colours.
