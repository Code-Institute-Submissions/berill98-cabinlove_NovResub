## The goal for this project

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

## User stories

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

## UX

### Fonts

- I have used Google Fonts to find the font that suits best to the feel of the website. I have used [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster) for the logo and the main titles.

### Icons

- The icons on the website were taken from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Colors and images

- The main colours on the website are different browns, white, and dark green. This is because I wanted to use natural colours.
